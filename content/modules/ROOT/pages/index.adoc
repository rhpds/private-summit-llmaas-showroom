= Private LLM as a Service - A Practical Introduction with OpenShift AI

== Step into the world of enterprise Generative AI deployment - one role at a time!

=== Welcome to the Workshop

This isn't a simple tutorial, this is the beginning of an adventure into the command center of an AI-powered enterprise!

In this hands-on session, you will rotate between key personas critical to delivering modern, production-level AI services:

* As a **platform engineer** you will design and deploy model serving environments and prepare the infrastructure that makes scalable model hosting possible.

* As an **AI application developer**, you will connect real applications to private LLM endpoints, integrate code assistant technology and explore the capabilities of agentic AI.

* Lastly, as an **technical decision maker**, you will see how to monitor and analyze your model usage across the cluster. 

At the end, you will walk away with practical experience across the lifecycle of model deployment.

== Workshop Agenda

=== **Module 1:** Setting Up the AI Backbone
Step into the role of platform engineer. You will see how to provision a scalable, secure Model-as-a-Service stack leveraging OpenShift AI - laying the necessary foundation for internal model hosting at scale.

=== **Module 2:** Activate the Code Assistant and Use AI to Enhance your Coding Skills
Now, shift to the app developer's perspective. Connect to the model endpoint you deployed and then integrate it into a developer facing code assistant to help you develop for your work, bridging infrastructure and app logic.

=== **Module 3:** Leverage the power of Agentic AI tooling
With the mindset of a site reliability engineer, you'll use model context protocol (mcp) and the LlamaStack API to interact more easily with your openshift cluster.

=== **Module 4:** Analytics
Take on the role of a platform SRE or product owner responsible for understanding how your private LLM is being used, and whether it's operating effectively at scale by exploring model usage analytics. 

=== **Module 5:** Reflect and Wrap-Up
Assess what you've built. We'll close with key takeaways, architectural guidance, and patterns you can bring back to your organization.

== Workshop Environment

For our workshop, we have provisioned an OpenShift Container Platform cluster for each participant, with Red Hat OpenShift AI deployed.

Each person attending this lab has a full admin access (`cluster-admin`) to their cluster to be able to do some of the exercises requiring admin priveleges.

== Embody the Role
You’re not just here to observe—you’re here to build, test, and troubleshoot like the teams responsible for AI in production!

At each phase, step into the persona, ask yourself:

**“If I were responsible for this in a real enterprise, what would I do?”**

**“What tooling do I need to trust this system at scale?”**

**“How can I make this AI infrastructure repeatable, observable, and secure?”**
