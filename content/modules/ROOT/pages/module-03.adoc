= 3Scale API Gateway

In this module, you will learn how to configure 3Scale API Gateway to give access to the models deployed in the previous module.

[#3scale-identify-config]
== 3Scale Overview

=== Connection to 3Scale Admin Portal

3Scale is an API management platform that provides a way to manage, secure, and analyze APIs. It allows you to create and manage API keys, set up rate limits, and monitor API usage.

As the deployment of 3Scale itself is not the purpose of this workshop and may take some time, we will use a pre-deployed instance of 3Scale in your environment.

To connect to the 3Scale admin portal, you will need the admin_user and admin_password values. They can be found in the `system-seed` secret in the `3scale` namespace.

We can also get them in this way:

* From a Terminal (in your VSCode environment, or on your laptop) log into OpenShift. If you don't know how to do this, here is the recipe:
** On the OpenShift Web Console, click on your user name then the `Copy Login Command` button in the top right corner of the screen. You will need to authenticate with your OpenShift credentials, and eventually accept a certificate if prompted.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-copy-login.png[]

** Copy the command and paste it into your terminal. It should look like this:
```bash
oc login -u <your-username> -p <your-password> --server=https://api.<your-cluster-name>.openshift.com:6443
```
(approve the certificate when prompted to allow insecure connections)

* Now that you are logged in, you can get the secret values with the following commands:

```bash
oc get secret system-seed -n 3scale -o jsonpath='{.data.ADMIN_USER}' | base64 --decode
oc get secret system-seed -n 3scale -o jsonpath='{.data.ADMIN_PASSWORD}' | base64 --decode
```

* Want to do it all in one command? Here you go:
```bash
oc get secret system-seed -n 3scale -o template='{{range $key, $value := .data}}{{if or (eq $key "ADMIN_USER") (eq $key "ADMIN_PASSWORD")}}{{printf "%s: " $key}}{{ $value | base64decode }}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}'
```

Now you can log into the 3Scale admin portal at `https://maas-admin.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}` using the credentials you just retrieved.

=== 3Scale Admin Portal

3Scale admin portal is where you can manage your APIs, create applications, and set up access control. You can also monitor API usage and set up rate limits.

The dashboard is divided into several sections:

* Audience: this gives you information about the users, registrations, etc.
* In the APIs section, you have an overview of:
** Products: this is where you can create the Products that people will have access to. You can see there are two products already created: `granite-3dot2-8b-instruct`, which is connected to the model that was pre-deployed,  and `API`, which is a default 3Scale echo API for testing.
** Backends: this is where you can see the backends that can be used by your products. You can see that the `granite-3dot2-8b-instruct` backend that is used by the the `granite-3dot2-8b-instruct` product.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-admin-dashboard.png[]

Using the dropdown menu at the top, you can access and explore the different admin sections: Audience, Products, Backends, and Account Settings.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-section-menu.png[]

As this workshop is not a full tutorial on 3Scale, we will not go into details about the different sections. You can find more information in the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_3scale_api_management/2.15[3Scale documentation].

However, we will come back to certain specific areas when we create a new product and connect it to the model that was deployed in the previous module.

=== Enabling the Developer Portal

Although you may have seen that a user was already created for you in 3Scale (Audience->Accounts->Listing), you will need to configure the developer portal to allow users to access it.

* On the Audience section, got o Developer Portal->Settings->Domains & Access.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-portal-menu.png[]

* The Developer Portal Access Code is used to control the access the developer portal. You can use the default value in the next section to connect to it, or simply delete it and click on `Update Account`. This will remove the access code and allow anyone to access the developer portal, although they will still need to authenticate. This is what we will do in this workshop.

[.bordershadow]

[#3scale-dev-portal]
== Developer Portal

=== Accessing the Developer Portal

You can now access the developer portal at `https://maas.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}`. You can log in using your workshop credentials (the same as the ones you used to log into the OpenShift console), because they are the ones we used to pre-create a user in 3Scale.

Here they are again:

* Your username: `{user}`
* Your password: `{password}`

Signing in:

* Click on the `Sign In` button in the top right corner of the screen
[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-signin-button.png[]

* Click on `Private login` and enter your credentials.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-signin.png[]

You should now be logged into the developer portal. You will be able to see the APIs that are available to you, and you can also create applications to get API keys.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-developer-loggedin.png[]


=== Creating an Application

Creating an application is the first step to getting an API key.

* Click on the `See your Applications and their credentials` link on the front page.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-see-applications.png[]

* You will be taken to the `Apps and API Keys` section, where you can see that there is an application that was already created for you (the 3Scale default Echo API). Start creating a new application by clicking on the `Create new application` button.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-create-application.png[]

* Select the Service you want to use. In this case, we will use the `granite-3dot2-8b-instruct` service that has been pre-deployed.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-select-service.png[]

* Give a name to your application, for example `Granite application`. Click on `Create Application`.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-application-name.png[]

* Your application has been created. You can see the Endpoint URL you can use to connect to the API, the name of the model you must use in your requests, and the API key that has been generated for you. You can now use this key to access the API.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-key-generated.png[]

=== Testing the API access

Now that you have created an application, you can test the API. You can do this using the `curl` command in your terminal.

* Open a terminal in your VSCode environment (or on your laptop) and run the following command, replacing the placeholder values with the ones you got from the previous step:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
    'https://Endpoint_URL/v1/completions' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer API_KEY' \
    -d '{
    "model": "Model_Name",
    "prompt": "San Francisco is a",
    "max_tokens": 15,
    "temperature": 0
}'
```

Example:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
    'https://granite-3dot2-8b-instruct-maas-apicast-production.apps.cluster-br294.br294.sandbox5291.opentlc.com:443/v1/completions' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer fa111c3b9cc911b982c7ac7bb15201ea' \
    -d '{
    "model": "ibm-granite/granite-3.2-8b-instruct",
    "prompt": "San Francisco is a",
    "max_tokens": 15,
    "temperature": 0
}'
```

You should get a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "id": "cmpl-7e1a2c3b9cc911b982c7ac7bb15201ea",
  "object": "text_completion",
  "created": 1677858240,
  "model": "ibm-granite/granite-3.2-8b-instruct",
  "choices": [
    {
      "text": " city in California known for its hilly terrain, iconic Golden Gate Bridge, and vibrant culture.",
      "index": 0,
      "logprobs": null,
      "finish_reason": "length"
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 4,
    "completion_tokens": 15,
    "total_tokens": 19
  }
}
```

== Creating a new Product in 3Scale

Now that you have discovered the Admin and the Developer portals from 3Scale and tested the API access, you are ready to create a new Product based on the model you deployed in the previous module. To do that we are going to use the 3Scale operator. This will show you how you can fully automate the deployment of new models in your service.

To work with to the 3Scale operator, you can use the OpenShift Web Console or the OpenShift CLI. In this workshop, we will show you how to use the OpenShift Web Console, but feel free to use the provided YAMLs through the CLI if you prefer.

=== Navigating to the 3Scale Operator

* In the OpenShift Web Console, click on the `Operators` menu on the left side of the screen, then select `Installed Operators`. On the top `Project` dropdown, select the `3scale` project.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-operator-menu.png[]

* Click on `Red Hat Integration - 3scale` operator from the list.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-operator-item.png[]

* You will be taken to the operator details page.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-operator-details.png[]

=== Creating a Backend

The first element you need to create is a Backend. This is the service that will be used by the Product to connect to the model endpoint.

* Click on the `3scale Backend` tab. You will see that there is already a backend created for the `granite-3dot2-8b-instruct` model.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-backend.png[]

* To deploy the new backend for TinyLlama, click on the `Create Backend` button.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-create-backend.png[]

* In the YAML view, replace the default content with the following YAML and click on create. This will create a new backend for the `TinyLlama` model.

```yaml
kind: Backend
apiVersion: capabilities.3scale.net/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: tinyllama
  namespace: 3scale
spec:
  name: TinyLlama
  privateBaseURL: 'https://tinyllama-llm-hosting.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}'
  systemName: tinyllama
```

* After a few seconds, you should see the new backend in the list of backends.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-tinyllama-backend.png[]


* You can also switch to the 3Scale Admin Portal and check that the new backend is listed there.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-tinyllama-backend-portal.png[]

=== Creating a Product

We are now ready to create the new Product that will use this backend. The Product is the element that will be used by the users to access the model.

* In the OpenShift Console, on the 3Scale operator, click on the `3scale Product` tab. You will see that there is already a product created for the `granite-3dot2-8b-instruct` model.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-product.png[]

* To deploy the new product for TinyLlama, click on the `Create Product` button.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-create-product.png[]

* In the YAML view, replace the default content with the following YAML and click on create. This will create a new product for the `TinyLlama` model. You can see that the configuration is more complex than the backend, as it includes the mapping rules, policies, and methods that will be used by the product.

```yaml

```

* After a few seconds, you should see the new product in the list of products.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-tinyllama-product.png[]

* You can also switch to the 3Scale Admin Portal and check that the new product is listed there.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-tinyllama-product-portal.png[]

* When a new Product is created, it is only available in a "staging" environment. This means that it is not yet available to the users. You need to publish it to make it available. This can be done in the 3Scale Admin Portal, or using the operator. In the operator view, click on the `ProxyConfig Promote` tab.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-proxyconfig-promote.png[]

* Click on the `Create ProxyConfigPromote` button.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-proxyconfig-promote-button.png[]

* In the YAML view, replace the default content with the following YAML and click on create. This will publish the product to the production environment.

```yaml
kind: ProxyConfigPromote
apiVersion: capabilities.3scale.net/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: tinyllama
  namespace: 3scale
spec:
  productCRName: tinyllama
  production: true
```

* In the 3Scale Admin Portal, you can see that the product is now published to production. Got to `Products`, select the `TinyLlama` product and go to ̀Integration->Configuration`. You can see that the `Production APIcast` environment is now available.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-tinyllama-proxyconfig-applied.png[]

* We must now create the API Documentation for the new product. We will again use the 3Scale operator to do this. Click on the `ActiveDoc` tab and click on the `Create ActiveDoc` button.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-create-activedoc.png[]

* In the YAML view, replace the default content with the following YAML and click on create. This will create the API documentation for the product. As the APIDoc can be complex, we already created a JSON file that contains the API documentation for the `TinyLlama` model and we will only need to reference it in the YAML.

```yaml
apiVersion: capabilities.3scale.net/v1beta1
kind: ActiveDoc
metadata:
  name: tinyllama
  namespace: 3scale
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: 3scale
spec:
  activeDocOpenAPIRef:
    url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-gpte-devopsautomation/lb1816-summit-llm-aas/refs/heads/main/bootstrap/3scale/api_definitions/tinyllama-1dash1b-chat-v1dot0.json'
  name: tinyllama
  productSystemName: tinyllama
  published: true
  skipSwaggerValidations: true
  systemName: tinyllama
```

* Finally, we must subscribe our user to this new product, like enabling them to use it. This is normally something you would automated as part of of a deployment of a new product, but this can be done in the 3Scale Admin Portal. Go to `Audience->Listing`, select `user1` account.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-user-product-activate.png[]

* In the account section, select the `Service Subscriptions` tab at the right.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-service-subscription-tab.png[]

* At the bottom right of the page, click on the `Subscribe` button on the `tinyllama` item.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-tinyllama-subscribe.png[]

* Select the `Default Plan` and click on `Create subscription`.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-tinyllama-create-subscription.png[]

* `user1` is now subscribed to the `TinyLlama` product. You can see that the subscription is active and the plan is set to `Default Plan`.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-tinyllama-subscribed.png[]

=== Testing the Product

You can now test this new Product in the same way you did for `Granite` in the previous module.

* Connect to the Developer Portal at `https://maas.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}` and log in using your credentials.

* Click on the `See your Applications and their credentials` link on the front page.

* Click on the `Create new application` button.

* Select the `TinyLlama` service.

* Enter a name for your application, for example `TinyLlama application`. Click on `Create Application`.

* Your application has been created. You can see the Endpoint URL you can use to connect to the API, the name of the model you must use in your requests, and the API key that has been generated for you. You can now use this key to access the API.

[.bordershadow]
image::03-3scale-tinyllama-info.png[]

* You can now test the API using the `curl` command in your terminal. Open a terminal in your VSCode environment (or on your laptop) and run the following command, replacing the placeholder values with the ones you got from the previous step:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
    'https://Endpoint_URL/v1/completions' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer API_KEY' \
    -d '{
    "model": "Model_Name",
    "prompt": "San Francisco is a",
    "max_tokens": 15,
    "temperature": 0
}'
```

Example:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
    'https://tinyllama-maas-apicast-production.apps.cluster-br294.br294.sandbox5291.opentlc.com:443/v1/completions' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer 5924457cf136e9906c5c98cc5924ab7a' \
    -d '{
    "model": "tinyllama/tinyllama-1.1b-chat-v1.0",
    "prompt": "San Francisco is a",
    "max_tokens": 15,
    "temperature": 0
}'
```

Congratulations! You have successfully created a new Product in 3Scale and connected it to the `TinyLlama` model.
